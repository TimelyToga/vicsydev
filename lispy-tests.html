    <h3>preramble</h3>
    <para>
    I prefer my tests simple and flexible, designed around the
    application rather than imposed on it. These days, I usually
    start with basic functions and assertions; and add what I need
    when I need it. The holy grail is a reusable
    library that allows the same progressive approach without
    getting in the way, while helping out with more elaborate tasks
    like test discovery, grouping and benchmarking. This post
    describes the humble beginnings of that library in
    Common Lisp.

    <h3>tags</h3>
    <para>
      Each test carries a unique set of tags in it's definition.
      When running tests, a set of tags may be specified to only
      trigger tests matching all specified tags. An optional set
      of tags to skip may also be specified; tests matching any
      specified tags are skipped, which allows
      excluding non relevant tests within the triggered set.
      The approach relies on creativity
      with a touch of discipline when specifying tags; but the
      process is gradual and non-intrusive, Just add whatever
      tags needed to accomplish what needs to be done and to take
      advantage of any patterns that emerge.

    <h3>benchmarking</h3>
    <para>
      Premature optimisation is the root of many problems,
      but so is not having any idea about the performance of
      your code. Unfortunately, I've found that most test
      frameworks don't even bother with benchmarks, and the ones
      that do require too much ceremony. There are no rational
      reasons for separating benchmarks and tests, the framework
      described here comes with the ability to run any set of
      tests as a benchmark with specified number of warmups and
      repetitions.

    <h3>fixtures</h3>
    <para>
      I prefer my fixtures to wrap around tests, to allow
      using block statements for allocating and releasing
      resources. Like tests, fixtures are uniquely identified
      by a set of tags. When running tests, fixtures matching
      skipped tags will not run.

    <h3>implementation</h3>
    <para>
      Included below is the complete implementation of all
      functionality described here, it's trivial enough to clone
      and own if you feel like tweaking it. Besides a few
      custom <a href="https://github.com/codr4life/cl4l/blob/master/utils.lisp">utilities</a>,
      it uses <a href="https://github.com/codr4life/cl4l#indexes">unique indexes</a>
      for mapping tags to tests and fixtures in order; the
      same thing could be accomplished with (gensym), (intern),
      built-in sets and manual sorting if you prefer more code
      in your code.

    <h3>language agnostic</h3>
    <para>
      I've been playing around with this approach for 20 years now,
      and I have yet to find a language where it isn't doable
      enough to improve on the status quo.
